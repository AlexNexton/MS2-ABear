***LingLang** is an online learning platform where children can learn or continue learning a second or third language through fun games. 
In my professional capacity as a teacher of languages, I designed the website in response to Covid-19 (in 2020) to enable parents to 
continue to provide language lessons while home schooling. Using games and online classes, the idea is to create an online community where
parents and their children can create new social enviornments and become part of a fun new unique way of learning.*


# ![Logo](assets/readmeImg/generalFrame.png) #

***Ling Lang's*** *Logo and the website's colours are drawn from the primary and secondary colours (red, blue, green, yellow) so that it appeals to children - especially with regards to the game pages.
The home page is a contrast of those colours so that the site also looks both professional for adults while maintaining a colourful nature for kids.*

## Design Choices ##

### Fonts ###

I chose a couple of font's to work with:

- [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville?query=libre)  mostly for the main site and some of game pages.
- [Josefin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans?query=jose#standard-styles) throughout the game pages.
- [Kalam](https://fonts.google.com/?query=kalam) for game title.
 
### Colours ###

I chose colours that would be appealing to the eye for both adults and children.

- [Color palette for main website](wireframes/style.css.pdf)

- [Color palette for Game Pages](wireframes/GamePagesColours.pdf)

These colours will compliment each other well when used across the site creating a pleasant ambience.

### Wireframes ###

I designed the site mock-ups using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). Each image/pdf shows a page and how the displays would change on different screen sizes such as **mobile**, **tablet** and **desktop**.
 
### My Wireframes ###

## SEO ##

Search Engine Optimisation for the site was provided in two complementary ways:
 - XML sitemap file saved in the root directory.
 - Google Search Console.

#### XML Sitemap file ####
- A sitemap.xml file was created to help search engines find, crawl and index the website more easily. 
It was created using[XML-Sitemaps.com](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) and entering the URL for the deployed website and letting it automatically generate the required xml data for the entire site.
The file was then saved in the GitHub repository root directory.

- The following steps were used to generate the sitemap.xml file:
  1. Visit [XML-Sitemaps.com](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) and enter the URL of the website https://alexnexton.github.io/MS2-LingLang/
  2. Click Start.
  3. The site pages will automatically be scanned.
  4. Click View Sitemap Details.
  5. Download the XML sitemap file.
  6. Save the sitemap.xml file in the root directory of the GitHub repository.

#### Google Search Console ####
- Google Search Console was used to assist with testing and indexing issues with the website and to see how the site performs in Google search results.

- The following steps were used to perform the indexing tests:
  1.  Visit [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home)
  2.  Click Add Property in the menu bar.
  3.  Enter the website URL https://alexnexton.github.io/MS2-LingLang/
  4.  Click Continue.
  5.  Download the unique verification file created by Google.
  6.  Save the [verification file](google52717a19da9cd4e1.html) in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
  7.  On Google Search Console, click Verify.
  8.  Once the verification passes, the site is available in the Google Search Console dashboard.
     ![Verification Image](assets/readmeImg/Google-img-verification.png)

Even though this website has a small number of pages and has navigation links on each page making the Sitemap largely unnecessary,
a friend of mine inspired me to add **Google Search Console** and **XML Site Map**. Along with the invaluable experience I learned he informed me that it's good practice to add these features in too.

## Version Control ##
**Version control** for this repository is managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** using separate [branches](https://github.com/AlexNexton/MS2-LingLang/branches)  used to work on specific aspects of the project.
The following describes the repository branch structure:
- **Master** - this is the default branch and the source for the repository deployment.
    - **readme** - this branch is used for updating the README.md and testing.md documentation only.
    - **coc** - (were coc are my initials) this branch is used as the main working branch for the website development

The following workflow steps are used to create and update branches within Gitpod and to push changes back to GitHub.

#### Gitpod Workspaces ####
1. Open **Gitpod** from **Github** using the Gitpod button. This needs to only be done **once** at the start of the project.
2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an **online IDE editor** window.

#### Branches ####
3. For changes to be made to any **readme files**, the git command `git checkout readme` is used to checkout and switch to the **readme branch**.
4. For changes to be made to **other files** under normal site development, the git command `git checkout coc` (where coc are my initials) is used to checkout and switch to the **coc branch**.
5. To create a **new branch**,  use the git command `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to **create and switch** to the new branch.

#### Working within a branch ####
6. **New** or **modified** files are **staged** using the `git add .` command
7. The changes are **committed** using `git commit -m "<commit message>"` command.
8. If the changes are in a newly created branch, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>` command as there is currently no upstream branch in the remote repository.
9. For branches that have already been synchronised, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push` command.

#### Merging branches in GitHub ####
10. Opening the repository in Github, a new **pull request** is created for the updated branch and assigned to the **Development project**.
11. The changes are **reviewed** to ensure there are **no conflicts** between the **updated branch** and the **Master branch**.
12. The changes are then **merged** into the **Master branch** and the merge request is **closed**. The **Project entry** is **automatically** moved to the **Done** card.

#### Update Gitpod with the latest GitHub commits ####
13. To update Gitpod with the **latest commits** From GitHub, the `git checkout master` command is used to checkout and switch to the master branch.
14. Use the `git pull` command to update the master branch and **reset the pointer**.
15. Now **switch** to the **other branches** in Gitpod using the `git checkout <branch-name>` command and use the `git merge origin/master` command to **update each branch in turn**.
16. Use the `git push` on **each branch** to update the relevant GiHub Branches to the **same commit** as the **Master branch**.
17. **Repeat steps 3 - 17 regularly** to ensure updates are **saved** and **correctly version controlled** in GitHub.

## Project Management ##

GitHub [Projects](https://github.com/AlexNexton/MS2-LingLang/projects) are used to organise the planning and development of the website using the Automated kanban template.
The following project cards are used to manage the tasks:
- **To Do** - this is the current work queue for the project.
- **In Progress** - this is the list of tasks currently in work.
    - New issues and pull requests are automatically added to this column using project card automation options.
- **Done** - completed tasks

Markdown syntax is used to create **"To-Do" list** style checkboxes by adding `- [ ]` for an un-ticked checkbox and `- [x]` for a ticked checkbox on cards as a way of splitting a single complex task into a list of steps to be completed.
