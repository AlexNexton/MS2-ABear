## Design Choices ##

### Fonts ###

I've have chosen(might change these) [Josefin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans?query=jose#standard-styles) for all of the headers and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=ralew#standard-styles) the rest of the text.  We have used a [Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat?query=caveat) font for the logo and headlines throughout the site.

### Colours ###

We have chosen the colour that say *"coffee now please!"*, applealing to the eye and also compliments the design of the project.
![Color palette](wireframes/png)

- *insert name* (#00000) - colour
- *insert name* (#00000) - colour
- *insert name* (#00000) - colour

These coulours will compliment each other well when used accross the site creating pleasant ambience.

### Wireframes ###

We designed our site moc-ups using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). We were focusing on defining basic layout structure of the site and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as [mobile](/wireframes/mobile.jpg), [tablet](/wireframes/tablet.jpg) and [desktop](/wireframes/desktop.jpg).
